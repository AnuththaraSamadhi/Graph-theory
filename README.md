This presents an analysis of the efficiency of three Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms - Kruskal's, Prim's Lazy, and Prim's Eager - applied to both dense and sparse graphs, using two different graph representations: adjacency matrices and adjacency lists. The experiments were conducted on graphs with approximately 5000+ nodes to evaluate the performance of these algorithms under various conditions.
